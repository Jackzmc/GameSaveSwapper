# Game Save Swapper

A tool that will swap the save directory of any game with a click of a button.
It is very alpha, but currently swapping _does_ work.

Check the releases tab to download a compiled build.

### Getting started
1. You should be on a screen that says there is no games. Click on 'Add Game'
2. Add in the name and where the game's save folder is. EXE & Steam option is OPTIONAL
3. Click Add and it should now show up in the dropdown list on the right
4. Add profiles on the left 
5. Right click on profile or click on Swap/Play (swaps then launches exe)
   
Your profile is created, except the program does not know currently what the game's current save belongs to, so you will need to right click on a save and click **Move Existing Save Here**. This will set the saves to be set for that profile.

Then you can swap profiles whenever you want!


## Notes

* Many features are in the todo list (Check the Projects tab on Github)
* Help would be appreciated
