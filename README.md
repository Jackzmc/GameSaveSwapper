# Game Save Swapper

A tool that will swap the save directory of any game with a click of a button.

It is very alpha, but currently swapping _does_ work.

### Getting started
1. You will need to create a game, go to the **Game Management** option.
2. Create a game, the exe location is **optional**
3. Close that window, and you'll see the game is in the combolist at the bottom. Type in the name of profile
   
Your profile is created, except the program does not know currently what the game's current save belongs to, so you will want to copy that to a certain profile's directory:
`%appdata%/GameSaveSwapper/GAMENAME/PROFILENAME`

Then you can swap profiles!


## Notes

* Many features are in the todo list (Check Main.cs or Projects if I set that up later on).
* Help would be appreciated
