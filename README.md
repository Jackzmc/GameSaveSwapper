# Game Save Swapper

A tool that will swap the save directory of any game with a click of a button.
It is very alpha, but currently swapping _does_ work.

Check the releases tab to download a compiled build.

### Getting started
1. You will need to create a game, go to the **Game Management** menu option.
2. Create a game,specifying the name and the save location. The EXE Location is *optional*
3. Close that window, and you'll see the game is in the combolist at the bottom. 
4. Type in the name of the profile and select the game
5. Right click on the profile and choose **Play** or **Swap**
   
Your profile is created, except the program does not know currently what the game's current save belongs to, so you will need to right click on a save and click **Move Existing Save Here**. This will set the saves to be set for that profile.

Then you can swap profiles whenever you want!


## Notes

* Many features are in the todo list (Check the Projects tab on Github)
